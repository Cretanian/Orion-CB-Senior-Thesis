# Prototyping smart community IoT applications via the NGSI protocol

In this thesis, we have successfully modeled with precision the interior of buildings using the FIWARE-NGSI (Next Generation Service Interfaces) protocol. To succeed, we extend the basic building data model provided by the FIWARE foundation and we create data models by considering spatial properties of the interior in buildings. To demonstrate our approach, we model the interior of the ICS-FORTH building. In particular, we extend a building-based smart data model (including floors, zones, rooms and devices) in order to cover all the inside spaces of a building. Moreover, we define and measure the spatial properties to those spaces and use them to perform complex accuracy queries. Such queries aim to enable IoT developers to create accurate applications in the main building of ICS-FORTH, as well as to any building modeled using our NGSI-model.  We demonstrate our modeling approach by implementing a prototype using the NGSI-based Orion context broker.
